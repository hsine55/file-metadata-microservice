Welcome :)

This is a File Metadata Microservice. It's the last API project in freecodecamp.com 
Cloud9 was used as IDE to build this project.


User Stories :

1) I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

2) When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

to run the app in cloud9 :

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
